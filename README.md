CppTestframework
================
A mini test framework to play with the nasty stuff in __cplusplus.

Here's my brief plan:

[Reflection]
+ Customized RTTI support to get rid of the standard "typeid" stuff
+ A manual reflection (reflection code is added by hand)
+ A parser based reflection (reflection code is generated by hpp parser & generator)

[Serialization]
+ Based on the reflection data(rather than hand-added code for each class)
+ So it is none-intrusive (since the reflection is already intrusive)
+ Pointer/reference graph walker: tree graph
+ Maybe I can find time for directional cycled or even general graph
+ Still I can look into Ogre for reference

[Garbage Collection & Smart Pointers]
+ GC can be easily built upon the serialization's pointer graph walker(to mark and sweep)
+ GC need a custom memory pool that provides a set of memory allocators for different purpose(Like havok)
+ Reference counter, weak pointer, pointer graph walking

[Language Binding]
+ LuaPlus
+ Extend Lua using C++
+ Extend C++ using Lua
+ (Optional):wxLua for wxWidget

[Multi Threading]
+ Look into boost and Ogre and Havok for inspiration
+ Implement a custom wrapper for Win

[Sort, Search, and container]
A summary of my preparations for recent interviews
+ Quick/Merge/Heap/Select/Bubble sorting, with profilers to give an intuitive understanding
+ Binary Search vs Hash
+ Implement a container from the scratch(Data structures, sorting, memory management, object management)
